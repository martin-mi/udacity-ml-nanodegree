    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "|   | someFeature |                    | someFeature_A | someFeature_B | someFeature_C |\n",

    "| 0 |  B  |  | 0 | 1 | 0 |\n",
    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",

    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "- Describe one real-world application in industry where the model can be applied. \n",
    "    - One example for a real-world usage of Random Forest is credit card fraud detection. The feature space is big when it comes to fraud detection. With Random Forest, the feature space is sampled and many different trees covering various fraud schemes can be trained. The resulting ensemble will then use that to predict fraudulent transactions. Source for RF evaluation in finance: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8361343\n",
    "- What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well?\n",
    "    - Strengths of Random Forest come from the combination of the underlying algorithms used: Decision Trees, bagging and random feature selection. This combination allows to create decision trees that can model simple and complex use cases (many features can be used). With usage of bagging and random feature selection, random forests achieve a reduced variance compared to single decision trees and, therefore, generalize better. They perform well even if the training data set is limited and there is a high dimensional feature space. Also, can be used for regression and classification tasks, so it's versatile.\n",

    "- What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?\n",
    "    - Weakness of this ensemble method is a lack of interpretability. If there are e.g. 10.000 trees used, it's basically a black box so interpretation of that will be very hard. Moreover, sample sizes of over 100k seem to be not well suited for ensemble methods in general as is suggested in https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/machine_learning_map/ .

    "    - The underlying decision trees of Random Forest make it possible to model simple and complex use cases. I can imagine that for this data set, there will be some 'simple' indicators (combination of few features) that do the right prediction. However, since we are analysing a real-world problem, there will be for sure also more complex cases where many features have to be combined to get to the desired result. I think random forests might excel in this combination due to their versatility.\n",

    "    - Don’t work well when you have lots and lots of noise, so when the classes are overlapping. Moreover, it might be hard to interpret the resulting model and the influence of single coefficients. The usage of SVMs depends on the properties of the data set - e.g. when the data set has 100s of features and the the Kernel trick is applied, the high dimensional space becomes huge and needs a lot of resources to compute / find a good separation. Sources: Udacity SVM Chapter in Nanodegree class.\n",
    "- What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?\n",
    "    - SVMs by default provide a good fitting mechanism (compared to for example Decision Trees who tend to overfit) and have a reasonable amount of hyperparameters to tune (e.g. C and gamma). My assumption/hope is, that the data set can be divided with usage of very few features that yield good performance metrics. If there are few outliers, these could be covered by gamma values that allow for 'special treatment'. \n",

    "### Implementation - Creating a Training and Predicting Pipeline\n",
    "To properly evaluate the performance of each model you've chosen, it's important that you create a training and predicting pipeline that allows you to quickly and effectively train models using various sizes of training data and perform predictions on the testing data. Your implementation here will be used in the following section.\n",
    "In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Import `fbeta_score` and `accuracy_score` from [`sklearn.metrics`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#sklearn-metrics-metrics).\n",
    " - Fit the learner to the sampled training data and record the training time.\n",
    " - Perform predictions on the test data `X_test`, and also on the first 300 training points `X_train[:300]`.\n",
    "   - Record the total prediction time.\n",
    " - Calculate the accuracy score for both the training subset and testing set.\n",
    " - Calculate the F-score for both the training subset and testing set.\n",
    "   - Make sure that you set the `beta` parameter!"

    "Looking at only the F0.5 score when 100% of the data is used, SVC and RFC perform roughly on the same level of 0.68 (SVC has a higher score of only 0.0037 more than RFC, what is negligible in my opinion), while KNN is on the level of 0.64 what is a little bit below both other classifiers. Based on F0.5 only no final decision can be made yet. However, taking into account model prediction time, RFC outperforms both other models by far - RFC needs around ~0.35 seconds for predicting new values, SVC ~19.7s and KNN ~26s. For the training time, KNN performs actually the best out of all the models with a time of ~1.1s compared to SVC with ~123s and RFC with ~7.2s.\n",
    "\n",
    "These findings show that RFC has a very similar F0.5 metric compared to SVC; however, RFC is much faster in training and prediction than SVC. KNN on the other hand, performs better only during training, in other metrics RFC performs better. In my opinion, I'd neglect this benefit of KNN over RFC since the training time overall is low (~1.1s vs. ~7.2s) and RFC has a better F0.5 metric and prediction times what I'd consider more important for CharityML. Overall, these results show that RFC is suitable for the dataset, performs the best and should be chosen to identify individuals that make more than $50,000. "

    "RFC (Random Forest Classifier) uses internally DTs (Decision Trees) for model training and predictions. Decision trees are basically if else statements based on data, e.g. if data point is 'female' then produce the following prediction. DTs are known to be susceptible for overfitting, which is a term that describes a model that instead of recognizing patterns in the data simply memorizes the data set. This is bad for prediction when new data arrives that was not present during the time of model training. To mitigate this issue, RFC uses techniques that are called bagging and random feature selection. With that, model training is performed on a subset of all available training data points and on a subset of their features. That improves the issue of overfitting. However, by reducing the training data set, the model becomes inaccurate since a lot of data is missing what is crucial for model training. To mitigate that, RFC performs many training runs, each running with a randomly selected subset of data creating a new decision tree. The result can be for example 10.000 decision trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a new data point is input to the model for prediction, all trees, in this example all 10.000, are supposed to make a prediction. RFC averages the prediction of all DTs and outputs a single prediction (source https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/ensemble.html#random-forests). "

    "3 out of 5 features were mentioned by me in the previous answer - however, in the opposite order. Looking at this diagram it's very clear that investments are a big factor in terms of income. Possibly, people who invest are financially comfortable and hence have higher income.\n",

    "Age is another big factor - it's weight is in between of capital_loss and capital_gain and also high. I'd have expected this feature to be less relevant in favor for e.g. education; what is not the case. The hours_per_week metric makes sense - the more someone works the higher the income."

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

    "The model with reduced data performs worse than the one trained on full data (F0.5 0.6674 vs. 0.7136). This in turn means the 5 most important signals are not enough to predict with the same high score.\n",

F0.5 decreases by a bit but the costs for training might be higher than sending out requests for donations. That is something that should be taken into consideration."
