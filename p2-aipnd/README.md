# AI Programming with Python Project

Project code for Udacity's AI Programming with Python Nanodegree program. In this project, students first develop code for an image classifier built with PyTorch, then convert it into a command line application.

The contents of this folder are copied from the [Udacity aipnd-project](https://github.com/udacity/aipnd-project.git) repository.

## Install

This project requires **Python 3.8** and the Python libraries outlined in `requirements.txt`.


## Usage

This project consists of a jupyter notebook and two command line applications:

- train.py
Trains a machine learning model for the [102 Category Flower Dataset](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/index.html).

- predict.py
Performs prediction to what flower category an image belongs.

Parameters for these two command line applications can be seen by running the scripts with the `-h` option.
