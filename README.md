## Projects

### 1 - Finding Donors for CharityML

In this project, different supervised learning algorithms are applied and optimized to predict the income based on the 1994 U.S. Census dataset.

### 2 - Image Classifier

This project is about building a neural network with PyTorch for image classificaiton based on the [102 Category Flower Dataset](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/index.html). It consists of a notebook in which model training is performed step by step as well as two command line applications that enable quick model training and prediction.

### 3 - Identify Customer Segments

This project uses a real world customer & demographics dataset on which an unsupervised learning technique is applied. Compared to the two previous projects, extensive data manipulation is performed to prepare the dataset for usage in machine learning algorithms.
